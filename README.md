# QRAMO-TwilightTales
 Card game to auto-generate a story, play as a pretentious author TV host explaining your work, compete against AI. Dumb idea for an "Apples to Apples" type of game I had in college, just leaning heavily on AI to implement.


This was a project to test Replit, and see if I could create a multiplayer Web game. (Answer: Yes, but only after restarting half a dozen times. And then a bunch of debugging time.)

Also, was testing Claude API -- "AI" player basically asks Claude (with character prompts) to give a written response like the human players.

I'll add common hang-ups/issues the agents kept getting death-looped/stuck on here later (maybe)

Images are AI generated, prompts are AI generated, code is AI generated, project framework is AI generated, lots of the debugging done by Claude talking to Replit Agent.
