# QRAMO-TwilightTales
 Card game to auto-generate a story, play as a pretentious author TV host explaining your work, compete against AI. Dumb idea for an "Apple to Apple" type of game I had in college, just leaning heavily on AI to implement.


This was a project to test Replit, and see if I could create a multiplayer Web game. (Answer: Yes, but only after restarting half a dozen times. And then a bunch of debugging time.)

Also, was testing Claude API -- "AI" player basically asks Claude (with character prompts) to give a written response like the human players.

I'll add common hang-ups/issues the agents kept getting death-looped/stuck on here later (maybe)
